# QB2025-Bueren

- Downloaded repo to posit
- created a "PackageInstall.Rmd" to install all necessary packages since this is a private workspace (not shared by admin/Quant Test 101)
- made edits and knitted HW worksheet 
- pushed back to git etc


##git install test manual

did it work?

if you want to add the git gui, after all steps, go to tools > project options > "turn on git + accept initialize new git" & restart. things still work normally. 

#git install easy version test
